These logos were drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format
[http://w3.org/Graphics/SVG] for RAC by Tyler Tidman, VA3DGN.

Inspiration for these logos was provided by the SVG version of the
ARRL ARES logo posted on Wikipedia
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ARES_Color_Logo.svg].

Software used:
  - Inkscape [http://inkscape.org] (0.46)
  - Imagemagick [http://imagemagick.org] (6.3.7)
  - GNU Make [http://gnu.org/software/make] (3.81)
  - Debian Linux [http://debian.org] (5.0 Lenny/Stable)

Type "make" to magically generate all .png, .jpg, .gif and .bmp versions
from the source .svg files.
